  <h3>Airspace</h3>
  <p>ASSelect generates airspace data for mainland UK in OpenAir format.</p>
  <p><em>I try to make this data as accurate as possible, but
  there will still be errors. Navigation is your responsibility,
  not mine. So don't blame me if you go somewhere you shouldn't have
  gone while using this data!</em></p>
  <h3>Output Format</h3>
  <p>The output format is OpenAir.<p>
  <p>The "OpenAir, RA(T) only" format downloads only the selected RATS.
  This lets you update your moving map software without needing to change
  the main airspace file.</p>
  <p>Competition format is for competition organisers only.</p>
  <h3>Airspace Types</h3>
  <p><em>Unlicensed Airfields</em> are aerodromes (without an ATZ) listed
  in section ENR&nbsp;5.5 of the AIP. The AIP does not include the majority
  of smaller airfields shown on the 1:500000 chart and so they are not
  included by ASSelect.</p>
  <p><em>Gliding Airfields</em> are listed in ENR&nbsp;5.5. ASSelect plots
  them with a radius of 1&nbsp;nm.  To avoid unnecessary airspace warnings
  ASSelect can exclude your home site.</p>
  <p><em>Microlight Airfields</em> are listed in ENR&nbsp;5.5 and
  plotted with a radius of 0.5&nbsp;nm by ASSelect.</p>
  <p><em>Obstacles</em> are listed in ENR&nbsp;5.4. ASSelect includes only
  obstacles with a height of greater than 600&nbsp;ft (mainly radio masts).</p>
  <p><em>ATZs</em>. A radio call is required before entering an active
  ATZ. The BGA recommend setting them to Class&nbsp;D as a reminder.
  However setting them as Control Zones instead will also generate an airspace
  warning while distinguishing them from true Class&nbsp;D airspace.</p>
  <p><em>ILS Feathers</em> are not strictly an airspace type but the
  BGA recommend a radio call if you fly in the vicinity. It's also
  recommended to set the airspace type to generate a warning on your
  moving map. Note the feather is symbolic only - the instrument
  approach procedure extends well outside the area of the feather.</p>
  <h3>Local Agreements</h3>
  <p>BGA letters of agreement are listed on the
  <a class="text-primary" href="https://members.gliding.co.uk/library/loas/">BGA website</a>.
  With the exception of the Cambridge RAZ a local club briefing is
  required before using any local agreement.</p>
  <p><em>Cambridge RAZ</em>. The Cambridge Radio Advisory Zone (RAZ)
  is not controlled airspace. You are encouraged to make contact with
  Cambridge Approach before entering the RAZ. Unlike other LOAs the RAZ is
  permanently enabled in ASSelect. Note - Openair doesn't support
  a RAZ airspace type so a Radio Mandatory Zone (RMZ) type is substituted.</p>
  <h3>Radio Frequencies</h3>
  <p>ASSelect optionally appends radio frequencies to the airspace name.</p>
  <h3>Temporary Restrictions, RA(T)</h3>
  <p>RA(T)s are detailed in Mauve AICs on the
  <a class="text-primary"
     href="https://nats-uk.ead-it.com/cms-nats/opencms/en/Publications/Aeronautical-Information-Circulars-AICs/mauve-aics/">
    NATS AIS website
  </a>.
  RA(T)s can be downloaded separately from the rest of the airspace,
  see Output Formats above.</p>
  <h3>Data</h3>
  <p>Airspace data is updated every four weeks - see
  <a class="text-primary"
    href="https://nats-uk.ead-it.com/cms-nats/export/sites/default/en/Publications/publication-schedule/10-year-AIRAC.pdf">
    Schedule
  </a>.
  I normally update this site approximately two weeks in advance of
  the effective date.<p>
